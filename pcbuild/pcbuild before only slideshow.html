						I recently built my first pc!  This was a big project for me since I started off not knowing very much about computer hardware.  Lots of research
						was done before any purchases were made on how the different components work together so this was a very good project for me to do.  I determined what I
						needed and wanted out of my build, created a parts list, posted my list on forums for feedback, purchased the parts, and then built the pc.  The entire 
						process took roughly 2 months from start to finish and I'm extremely happy with the results.
						</br>
						</br>
						<div align="center">

							</br>
							All of the parts in their shiny new boxes.  Case, GPU, CPU, PSU, MOBO, HDD, SDD, RAM, optical drive, and aftermarket cooler.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-2.jpg">
							</br>
							Installing the CPU was a little nerve racking - it took a lot of force to clamp the level shut on the mother board.  I was worried it was going to break but it
							ended up snapping into place.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-3.jpg">
							</br>
							The EVO 212 cooler is massive!  I had to take off the case's side-wall fan for it to fit properly.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-4.jpg">
							</br>
							The 2.5" SSD had to be mounted to the bottom of the case which I didn't like very much.  It didn't leave enough room for the cables in order for the drive to be
							properly secured.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-5.jpg">
							</br>
							The GTX 970 GPU was also massive!  I really like the way the card looks in the case.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-6.jpg">
							</br>
							Nice looking PSU and especially like how the cable mesh wrap looks.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-7.jpg">
							</br>
							First look after mounting all of the components.  
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-8.jpg">
							</br>
							Another angle with all of the compnents in.  Nice quick release lever for holding in the optical drive - which reads Blue-Ray, R/W DVD, and R/W CD.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-9.jpg">
							</br>
							Starting working on cable management and figuring out how the front components hook up to the MOBO.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-10.jpg">
							</br>
							After installing all of the parts I went to try it out.  Every time I would attempt to power the PC on it would shut itself off after about 1/2 second.  Started 
							trouble-shooting to see what the problem was.  Disconnected most of the parts to eliminate possibilites and originally thought it was the MOBO shorting out on the case.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-11.jpg">
							</br>
							Tried using a friend's PSU and it turns out that was the issue.  Ended up having Amazon send me a new one and I sent back the defective one.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-12.jpg">
							</br>
							Shot of after putting in the new PSU and reconnecting all of the parts.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-13.jpg">
							</br>
							This time the PC stayed on and worked perfectly.
							</br>
							</br>
							<img class="pcImage" src="/pcbuild/pc-14.jpg">
							</br>
							Very happy with this build - cost, looks, and performance wise.  I'll probably make another build in a couple of years.
