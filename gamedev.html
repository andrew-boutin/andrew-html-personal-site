						One of my favorite hobbies is making video games.  I've worked on both individual games and group 
						projects using a variety of technologies.  Lately I've been using the 
						<a class="link" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity Engine</a> 
						for most of my projects.  Currently, I'm focusing on the Crazy Canal Tower Defense game listed below.  
						Feel free to download any of the available games listed here.

								<strong>Game Overview:</strong></br>
								Geo Wars is a 2D single player side-scroller platform shooter.  The player has control over
								their character (left, right, and jump) and has access to four different weapons: pistol, 
								shotgun, and two automatic weapons.  Currently there is only one level consisting of 
								platforms, spikes, red grunts, and a ninja warrior at the end.  The grunts start moving 
								towards the player when within a certain distance.  The boss can jump, has a sword, and 
								chases after the player when within a certain distance.  If the player hits the spikes or 
								any of the enemies they die and start back at the beginning of the level.  The player gets 
								three lives and in order to beat the level they have to kill the boss.  The object is to 
								clear the level as many times as possible with only the three lives.  Enemies get more 
								health and are faster each level.
							</p>
							<hr>
							<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></br>
								I'm in the process of contacting the game owner to figure out why the game isn't playable at the moment. 
								The game is hosted on Kongregate 
								<a class="link" href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/EclisionGames/geo-wars">[Play GeoWars]</a> 
								and requires 
								<a class="link" href="https://unity3d.com/webplayer">WebPlayer</a>
								to be installed.  WebPlayer allows games developed using Unity to 
								be played in web browsers.  If you have a Kongregate account then you can get your high 
								score saved on the site.

								<hr>
								<strong>Game Overview:</strong></br>
								Labyrinth Crawl is a terminal based strategy game, and the object is to make it
								through 10 levels to escape.  Each level is a randomly generated maze with
								many dead ends.  Also, each level is littered with enemies that are randomly placed throughout
								the maze.  They don't move but can block paths.  The player can attack the enemies at the
								risk of losing health to continue down the path.  Each level of the labyrinth has more enemies
								than the previous one.  Another twist is the player only sees parts of the map that they have
								traversed so far.  This forces the player to choose which enemies to battle to open up certain
								paths.  The player starts off with full health on each each level of the maze.  This game forces
								the player to use some strategy combined with a bit of luck to make it out alive.
