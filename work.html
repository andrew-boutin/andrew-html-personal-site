								I did a summer internship on the Development Operations Team and got to work with a wide range of technologies.  
								My main focus was on supporting/enhancing existing and creating new in-house tools for managers and developers. 
								This was mostly focused on web-based applications using a database backend, business logic level,
								and client side interface.
								</br></br>
								This involved working with a wide range of technologies.  Python, C#, SQL, LINQ, ASP.NET MVC, SQL 
								Server, MySQL, Eclipse PyDev, Microsoft Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL workbench, 
								Jira, Stash, Confluence, SourceTree, Bugzilla, ClearQuest, and Git.  Some other things included working with
								Linux/Windows, using an Agile development strategy, practicing ETL, and learning about three tiered business
								applications.</br></br>
								<strong>Defect Reporting Application:</strong></br>
								My first project involved adding new features to an existing web-application and fixing bugs that I found 
								along the way.  The application used ASP.NET, C#, and SQL databases.</br></br>
								<strong>Defect Density Metrics:</strong></br>
								I was involved in the design, implementation, and testing of this project.  It consisted of a Python back-end, ran 
								on a server, used to retrieve defect data from different repository systems (code files) and bug tracking systems 
								(bug reporting data) for company products.  This information was compiled to come up with different metrics related
								to defect density.  The information was stored into a staging database that was polled by a web application that could 
								be viewed by clients to interactively display the data.

								After a few months I was hired on as a regular employee.  My main focus was on creating a plugin
								to interact with an external public open source program and some company software.  Other work was 
								also done during this time period.</br></br>
								Utilized Python for a plugin involving client/server networking.  Developed algorithms for a heart rate 
								variability statistical analysis program using C++ and CodeBlocks.</br></br>
								<strong>Plugin:</strong></br>
								Created a plugin for an open source program called OpenSesame to work in conjunction with software 
								provided by iWorx Systems, Inc. OpenSesame is used to design social science experiments, and the iWorx 
								software collects and displays physiology data. The plugin establishes a client connection from OpenSesame 
								to a server ran by the iWorx software. The plugin allows experiments in OpenSesame to send messages, data, 
								and time stamps of events to the iWorx software and display them on the screen. This allows the physiology 
								data collected during experiments to be synchronized to what was happening in the social science experiment. 
								Previously, separate charts were recorded and then later compared. This plugin allows all of the data to be 
								centralized in a single program. The plugin was written in Python, and the server portion was written in C++. 
								The Python portion was written entirely by myself and another employee contributed to most of the C++ portion.
								</br>
								</br>
								This plug-in was released in the company's newsletter and mentioned in an 
								<a class="link" href="http://www.iworx.com/teaching-landing/newsletter/view-newsletter/?nlid=2864#Downloadsless">article</a>.

								My first few months consisted of writing micro-controller firmware for a couple of different 
								embedded systems and working with a 3D printer.</br></br>
								Developed firmware, in C, for micro-controllers in embedded systems for data acquisition from external products.  Also 
								calibrated, modified, and tested a 3D printer.</br></br>
								<strong>iWire-PO2-100 Pulse Oximeter:</strong></br>
								Developed firmware for PIC32 micro-controller in an embedded system for data acquisition from a 
								dual-wavelength light transmittance based finger clip. Synchronization of data and data error 
								checking was required once data had been obtained from the finger clip. Once checks were 
								complete data had to be altered and transferred to another external device in order to be 
								displayed through computer software. C was used in MPLAB X IDE v1.60 to complete this project. 
								Project required thorough research on the finger clip's product protocol in order to interface 
								with the device.

								The <a class="link" href="http://www.iworx.com/products/iwire-devices/iwire-po2-100/">device</a> is currently 
								for sale on the company's website.</br></br>
								<strong>Sonar Detector:</strong></br>
								Developed firmware for PIC32 micro-controller in an embedded system for data acquisition from 
								a sonar detector. Had to send correct voltages to the sonar detector to trigger data collection. 
								Synchronization of data and data error checking was required once data had been obtained from 
								the sonar detector. Once checks were complete, data had to be altered and transferred to another 
								external device in order to be displayed through computer software. C was used in 
								MPLAB X IDE v1.60 to complete this project. Project required thorough research on the sonar detector's 
								product protocol in order to interface with the device. Firmware was developed for multiple types of 
								sonar detectors before the final model was chosen.

								The device was developed for National Instruments. Another employee assisted with the firmware used 
								on the final model of sonar detector.
